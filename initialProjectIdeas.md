## Possible Ideas for capstone 2

--- Favorite idea ---

### While all ideas are seemingly on my agenda as future projects. I'm leaning towards doing the document storage site for the capstone. This is a needs based project as the agency I work for has indicated they would benefit from an app such as this and if it goes as planned, it would become a scalable and sellable solution for other agencies as well. I'm aware it does not include as much API data for the actual site to function, but when tied to an independent database, it will still utilize the same functionality

--- All Idea Suggestions ---

1. Document storage system with automatic updating ticklers. 
    - I work for an agency that has to maintain facilities in certain repair and certain documentation. Our current system is to email our documents from our facilities to our main agency office and a person has to log those documents one by one and manually update a tickler. It's clunky and often falls behind. 
    - I would build my own api that would work with a database to store any documentation entered by users (agency employees or contractors.). This would update the database to reflect current documentation. It would also update tickler. The tickler can be viewed on the site and will automitically email end user and/or supervisor at 30, 60, 90 days (as an example) to give individuals time to update or complete any coming due documentation. It would also store copies of the documents so they can be pulled for the appropriate file when necessary. 

2. Family Recipe Blog Site
    - Could potentially use calorie or health api to calculate macros, etc. which would be handy for anyone on a particular diet for health or aesthetic reasons. 
        - Some family members are diabetic or pre-diabetic or have high blood pressure or have to avoid certain foods for other reasons. So calculating calories, sugar, or other ingredients could be helpful in allowing users to decide which recipes they want to make.
    - The site would exist more as a place for a family or family like group of people to share recipes and memories they have associated with those recipes. Some of my family is older now and I don't get to hear there stories from youth as often. This would be a place that would help those memories stay alive, even if some of those people are no longer with us. 

3. Agro-business app. 
    - This would link a few different api's together possibly including satellite data imagery, soil sample, sale prices of crops, maps and boudaries of fields, etc.
    - Targeted toward smaller farms and independent providers, the idea of this app is to have a place to record agricultural decisions records to reflect and plan for the future. This could include satellite imagery of fields, outline bounderies of where crops were planted, how fertilizer was applied, date records, yield records from past years and projections for the coming season(s).
